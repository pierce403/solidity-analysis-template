# Logs Directory

This directory is for storing logs generated during the smart contract security audit.

## Tool Outputs
The output of any automated analysis tools, test results, or scripts should be saved in this directory. This helps in keeping a record of tool execution and their raw results for later review.

Examples include:
- **Static Analysis Reports:** Slither, Mythril, Semgrep, and 4naly3er outputs
- **Test Results:** Foundry/Hardhat test execution logs and coverage reports
- **Gas Analysis:** Gas consumption reports and optimization recommendations
- **Compilation Logs:** Solidity compiler warnings and error outputs
- **Deployment Logs:** Contract deployment transaction records and verification logs

## Agent Log (`agent.log`)
A file named `agent.log` should be maintained within this directory. This log is specifically for tracking actions performed by an AI agent during the smart contract audit.

Each entry in `agent.log` should be appended and follow this format:

```
[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] - <Action Description>: <Brief Summary of Result/Observation>
```

**Examples:**
```
[2023-10-27 14:35:10] - Ran Slither analysis on TokenContract.sol: Found 3 medium and 2 low severity issues.
[2023-10-27 14:50:22] - Analyzed reentrancy in withdraw function: Confirmed vulnerability, writing PoC test.
[2023-10-27 15:15:45] - Reviewed access control in admin functions: Found missing modifier on critical function.
```

This log helps in maintaining transparency and an audit trail of the AI agent's activities during the smart contract audit engagement.
