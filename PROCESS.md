  - [ ] Create detailed technical findings report
  - [ ] Provide actionable remediation roadmap
  - [ ] Include post-deployment monitoring recommendations

## Continuous Focus Areas Throughout Audit:

### **Money Security Questions to Always Ask:**
1. "How can an attacker steal funds from this function?"
2. "What happens if this external call fails?"
3. "Can this state change be exploited for financial gain?"
4. "Are there any fund lock scenarios in this code path?"
5. "How can access controls be bypassed?"

### **State Modification Red Flags:**
- Unchecked balance updates
- External calls before state changes
- Missing input validation
- Inadequate access controls
- Complex mathematical operations without overflow protection

### **Criminal Exploitation Indicators:**
- Direct fund transfer capabilities
- Privilege escalation opportunities
- Oracle manipulation vectors
- Flash loan integration points
- Emergency function abuse potential

Remember: The goal is to think like both a security researcher and a criminal. Every line of code should be evaluated for its potential to be exploited for financial gain or to cause fund loss.
