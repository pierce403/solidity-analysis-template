# Hardware Security Wisdom

This document contains curated advice for hardware security analysis.

## Key Focus Areas

- **Physical Inspection:**
  - Identifying components (MCUs, memory chips, debug ports).
  - Looking for tampering indicators.
- **Firmware Extraction & Analysis:**
  - JTAG, SWD, UART interfaces.
  - Chip-off techniques.
  - Firmware reversing (e.g., using Ghidra, IDA Pro).
- **Side-Channel Attacks:**
  - Power analysis.
  - Electromagnetic analysis.
- **Fault Injection:**
  - Voltage glitching.
  - Clock glitching.
- **Common Hardware Vulnerabilities:**
  - Insecure debug interfaces left open.
  - Lack of firmware signing/encryption.
  - Weaknesses in secure boot implementations.
