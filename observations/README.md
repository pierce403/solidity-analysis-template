# Observations Directory

This directory is for recording interesting observations, potential areas of concern, or code patterns discovered during the smart contract audit that warrant further exploration.

Think of this as a scratchpad or a log of things that catch your eye but haven't yet been fully investigated or confirmed as vulnerabilities.

## Purpose:
- To keep track of suspicious code patterns that need deeper analysis
- To note down unusual contract interactions or dependencies
- To brainstorm potential attack vectors based on initial code review
- To document gas inefficiencies or optimization opportunities
- To record questions about protocol mechanics or economic models

## Examples of Observations:
- Complex external calls that might be vulnerable to reentrancy
- Unusual access control patterns that need verification
- Arithmetic operations without overflow protection
- Oracle dependencies that might be manipulable
- Upgrade mechanisms that seem risky
- Economic incentives that might be exploitable

Files in this directory are typically informal and for internal team use during the audit. They may or may not lead to formal findings.
