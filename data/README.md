Examples include:
- **Smart Contract Source Code:** `.sol` files and related contracts
- **Deployment Artifacts:** Compiled bytecode, ABIs, deployment scripts
- **Configuration Files:** Hardhat/Foundry configs, environment files
- **Protocol Documentation:** Whitepapers, technical specifications, API docs
- **Static Analysis Reports:** Slither, Mythril, and other tool outputs
- **Test Files:** Existing test suites and custom audit tests

Organize files in subdirectories by contract or component for clarity.
